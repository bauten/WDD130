        <p>
            What can we say about Pete? Well I think first and foremost he is a funny man. One rafting adventure with him and he'll have your 
            whole boat laughing so hard you'll have to watch out for yellow water. He has been with us on the river for ten years and has loved
            every second of it. He also enjoys rock climbing in his spare time and is an avid outdoorsman. He is hoping to 
            be able to join the forestry service and keep up this great life.

        <p>
            One look at Jack and you will see he is the definition of a river rat. He loves the water and most days you
            can find him out in the water. He loves white water kayaking and goes to the extreme with it. If you want a fun ride he is 
            definently the guide for you. He is the son of the owner of Alpine River Adventures and has been rafting from the young age of 4.
            This is his dream job and he enjoys every second he spends on the river with all of you!
