      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>How do you see the world? My name is Brayden Auten and I offer a different point of view.  Over the last few years I have been working with drones to develop methods to help with a variety of situations, wether they be comercial, construction, inspections, 3D models, etc. If you can imagine it we can work out a way to get it done. This website is to help broadcast my services and show what the world can look like from up above. 
    </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I intend to reach a wide range for my audience. I want to target tourism/photogography which will have a general middle age range. Anywhre from late 30's to late 50's. We have so much beautiful moments up here that can only be caught by drone footage. I also want to target commercial/construction users and to show them the many uses drones have on progress updates and inspections that can eliminate costly options that they currently use. That will also target around the same age group.</p>  <!-- change this -->
