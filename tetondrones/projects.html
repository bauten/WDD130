            Here we recently did a 3D model of a strip mine up in the teton area. We were hired to get the 3D
            Model so that they would be able to calculate several different variables. One was the amount of earth that 
            has been removed from the mine. Another was the angle of the siding to make sure that the site remains safe.
            We did this by taking our drone along with an rtk monitor to get the most accurate data and using ground control 
            points to maintain that accuracy. We flew the drone gathering pictures at predetermined points and with an overlap
            of eighty percent. This allowed us to use a photogrammetry software called pix4d to stitch the photos together and
            use advance mathmatics to get the 3D image.

            Pepperwood is a proposed housing project site in Rexburg Idaho. We were hired on to try and determine 
            the amount of watershed that would happen if the areas were made impermeable. That means that water would not pass 
            through the surface. This helps us to be able to plan for drains in the right area so that the risk of flooding
            would decrease. In this picture you can see that the area in red shows the areas with the most impermeableity 
            we can then use that and other spatial tools to calculate how much and to where would the water flow.

            Gold, that is a word that makes you sit right up. Caribou City, a ghost town, was once full of Gold.
            We recently have teamed up with a historical society here in Idaho to try and map out this once
            prosperous town. At one point it had 1500 workers and more. It was a town of over 40 saloons and brothels.
            This entire town was burnt down in the late 1800's and now all that remains of it is one lone broken down
            cabin. We went up to the site with the goal of determining the original layout of the town. We were planning
            to use both photogrammetry and Lidar to get the best data of the surface from the area. We were then able to 
            analyze the surrouinding areas and pick out several likely locations of buildings. One problem we ran into 
            was the amount of work that has been done to the area following the destruction of the town by more modern 
            equipment.
