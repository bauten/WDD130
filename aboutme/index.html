    <h2>Brayden Auten</h2>
    <p>My name is Brayden Auten, I am a Geospatial Computing major and am finally graduating this semester. I currently live in Rigby Idaho with my wife and two daughters and I love the area and the people around me. I am ready for this spring and summer as it has been a long winter. I am currently doing an internship at a local utility company and I really enjoy it as it has exposed me to the huge world that is data science. 
    <p>

    </p>Since my degree is more heavily weighted in GIS, I have not been the best at improving my coding skills but I hope to improve on them this semester.  I took a data wrangling class last semester and I really enjoyed working with R because it really took me out of my comfort zone. I am looking forward to working with all of you!</p>
